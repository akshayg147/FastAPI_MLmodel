Refer the HTML file and change the backend server adderess in fetch.

By default fast api runs on localhost:8000.

Run the fast api with 
```uvicorn app:app```

Once done, launch the frontend like this, http://localhost:5500/frontend.html
If frontend uses different port on launch then change the URI in specified in CORS in app.py




Thank you.
